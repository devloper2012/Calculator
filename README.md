 **Calculator Project**:

This project is a simple yet fully functional **calculator application** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It provides an intuitive interface with essential mathematical operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo, squaring a number, and an **All Clear** (AC) button. The design is user-friendly and responsive, making it accessible across different screen sizes.

### **Features:**
- **Basic Operations:** Perform basic arithmetic operations like **addition (+)**, **subtraction (-)**, **multiplication (x)**, **division (/)**.
- **Advanced Functions:** Includes additional features such as **Modulo (%)** and **Square (xÂ²)** operations.
- **Clear Functionality:** The **AC** (All Clear) button resets the current input.
- **Equal Functionality:** The **=** button evaluates the current expression and displays the result.
- **Responsive Design:** Utilizes **Bootstrap** to ensure the application is fully responsive and works well on mobile and desktop devices.

### **Technologies Used:**
- **HTML:** For creating the structure of the calculator, including the buttons and display.
- **CSS (Flexbox & Bootstrap):** For styling the calculator layout, ensuring the application is visually appealing and responsive.
- **JavaScript:** To add interactivity, such as button clicks, handling the calculations, and updating the display.

### **Project Overview:**
This project serves as a practical implementation of core web development concepts, especially JavaScript functions, event listeners, and DOM manipulation. By creating this calculator, you will gain hands-on experience in building interactive applications using the fundamentals of web development.

The project also incorporates responsive web design practices using **CSS Flexbox** and **Bootstrap**, ensuring that the calculator adapts to different screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktops.

### **Key Learning Outcomes:**
- Understanding how to link HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a single web application.
- Mastering the basics of **DOM manipulation** (accessing and modifying HTML elements) with JavaScript.
- Implementing **event listeners** to handle user input and trigger calculations.
- Gaining experience with CSS layouts using **Flexbox** and **Bootstrap** to create a responsive and user-friendly design.

### **Future Improvements:**
- Add more advanced mathematical functions like square roots, trigonometric functions, or memory operations.
- Implement error handling for invalid operations (e.g., division by zero).
- Improve design with custom themes or animations.
